// same like stringBuilder with only difference is that StringBuffer is thread-safe, means we can work on same stringBuffer at same time

// java handles it by if two thread needs access then one will wait till other finish the operations

public class StrBuffer {
		
		public static void main(String[] args) {
				StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
