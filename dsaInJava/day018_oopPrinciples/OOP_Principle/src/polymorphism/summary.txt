6Polymorphism means different way to express same thing.

1. Compile-Time polymorphism / Static Polymorphism
=> Achieved by method overloading [operator overloading is not supported in java ]

Method overloading means methods with same name but different types, arguments, return types and order.

A a1 = new A();
A a2 = new A(1.0,2);



2. Runtime or Dynamic
=> Achieved by method overriding
Overriding means same name, same arguments, same return type, same order but body is different.


Overriding is possible only when refrence variable is of super-class and object is of sub-class.

Parent obj = new Child();

Here which property to access is determined by refrence variable.

and which method to run is determined by the object, this is k/a upcasting.

How java determine which method to run??
=> By dynamic method dispatch



3. Final class cant be overridden or inherited

4. Staic method lai override garna mildena
