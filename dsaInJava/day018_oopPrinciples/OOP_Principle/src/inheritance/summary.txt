Single Inheritance
A => B i.e B extends A


Multi level inheritance
A => B => C i.e B extends C and C extends B


Multiple Inheritance
A => B <= C i.e B extends A and B extends C
					if A and C has same property then B will be confused which one to call. So, java dont support this.


Hierarchical  Inheritance
D <= A => E
B <= A => C
Many class extends one class.


Hybrid Inheritance    [Not in java]
B <= A => C
||																			||
===> D <===
Present single and double inheritance


A class cant be its own super class.
i.e A extends A is not possible.
