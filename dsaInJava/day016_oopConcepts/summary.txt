Class is like blueprint or template which is used to create custom data type as per need.

1. Declaration of class is done by :
 class ClassName{
 	[methods
 	...
 		]
 }
 
2.  instance of class is created by :
 ClassName varName = new ClassName( [para1, para2...] );
 
3.  new keyword is used to make object/instance of class and the object is stored in heap memory.

4. Primitive data types are not objectified with 'new' keyword because heap is slower than stack memory.

5. If we want to create object of primitive data type then it is only possible by the help of wrapper class
like this : Integer a = new Integer(5);

6. We cant destroy object on our own in java. It is automatically handled by Garbage Collector.

7. We can do constructor overloading of class by varying the number of arguments.
